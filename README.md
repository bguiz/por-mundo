# Por Mundo

For Earth

## How it works

- Make use of the base technical system designed/ implemented by
[status based profiles for peer verified actions](https://github.com/bguiz/peer-verified-actions).
- Configure the list of available actions to those that are:
  - Beneficial for the Earth in some manner,
    for example those that would net CO2e
  - Feasible for regular people to do,
    where "regular people" means those who do not own/ control a corporation
    or otherwise have access to a lot of capital and resources

## Desired outcomes

- Foster an active user base of users who
  - Care about Earth, and want to mitigate or reverse the damage that we have done to it
  - Are willing to take action themselves on a weekly basis
  - Share their actions beyond the scope of this system,
    e.g., on social media
- Create "influencers" or ambassadors for people who do things for the earth
- Reach a 3.5% penetration rate in in as many regions as possible around
  the world

## Actions

All actions may be found within the `actions` directory of this project.

The baseline number of points for each action is based on a proportion
of net CO2e that the action would be equivalent to.
However, note that there may also be bonus points, which are variable,
and not necessarily tied to particular actions.
Thus the number of points earned by a user for taking, verifying, or sharing
an action can vary based on context.
