# Por Mundo

For Earth

## How it works

- Make use of the base technical system designed/ implemented by
[status based profiles for peer verified actions](https://github.com/bguiz/peer-verified-actions).
- Configure the list of available actions to those that are:
  - Beneficial for the Earth in some manner,
    for example those that would net CO2e
  - Feasible for regular people to do,
    where "regular people" means those who do not own/ control a corporation
    or otherwise have access to a lot of capital and resources
